Your new iPhone data plans are absolutely ridiculous. Virtually every other
country offering the iPhone includes unlimited data at no extra premium. The
fact that the data bandwidth offered for each iPhone plan is so low coupled
with the latest 3G capabilities effectively renders the device useless. The
estimated usage scenarios per plan are not realistic and do not factor in
secondary data usage options (i.e. 3G applications, iTunes Store, &amp;c...).
Not to mention next to no minutes and SMS, and lack of a rollover minutes
capability. It’s as if you are barely offering a service, and simply charging
for iPhone ownership. You are locking Canadians in to what seem to be third
world plans from nearly a decade ago. It’s not fair to your loyal customers who
are being forced to pay these exorbitant prices.

It’s truly a sad day for Canadians and tech enthusiasts, knowing we have been
abandoned by the one company that really could have made a difference.

Sincerely,

Gianni Chiappetta
