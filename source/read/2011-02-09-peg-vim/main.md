### Parsing Expression Grammars in Vim

Recently I've been doing quite a bit of work with [Parsing Expression Grammars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) (or <abbr title="Parsing Expression Grammar">PEG</abbr> for short). They're very powerful tools for matching complex patterns. Inimino's [PanPG](http://boshi.inimino.org/3box/PanPG/about.html) is the awesome PEG library I've been working with to make some cool stuff (you should check it out!). Anyway, lack of syntax highlighting in Vim has caused me to overlook small errors at times, this has prompted me to write `peg.vim`, a syntax definition for vim.

### Get It

I recommend using [pathogen](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332) to install `peg.vim` as a bundle.

You can grab the latest version from the [peg.vim Github repo](https://github.com/gf3/peg.vim).

Here's what it looks like in my colour scheme:
